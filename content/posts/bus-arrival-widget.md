## Motivation

The current bus app are provided by the major bus comapny in my location, which are KMB and CityBus. These apps have a pretty long loading time along with the advertisement time.

It takes around 20 seconds from unlocking to phone to seeing the arrival time of the bus route on screen. I hope to create a widget that can periodically fetch data for a particular stop from the bus arrival time api, to display directly the arrival time on my screen. 
 
 Hopefully this would reduce the loading time from unlock screen to getting the info to 5 seconds. The saved 15 seconds could determine whether one has to wait 8 minutes or 1 minutes for the bus. :smirk:
